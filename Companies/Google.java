//Implement method:
//List<Range> getRanges(List<Shard> shards, List<Key> keys)
//That returns list of ranges. Each range represents multiple keys aggregated over a shard:
//n-keys -> 1-shard -> 1-range
//
//Method should return no more than 1 range per shard that spans all keys or their parts belonging to this shard.
//
//Each of the `Range`, `Shard` and `Key` classes have `end` and `start` fields of int type, where `start` is inclusive and `end` is exclusive.
//
//Example:
//1-9, 12-59, 100-999 <- shards (input)
//2-3, 6-8, 11-20, 200-220 <- keys (input)
//2-8, 12-20, 200-220 <- ranges (output)
